* [HBASE-21871](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-21871) | *Major* | **Support to specify a peer table name in VerifyReplication tool**

After HBASE-21871, we can specify a peer table name with --peerTableName in VerifyReplication tool like the following:
hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.replication.VerifyReplication --peerTableName=peerTable 5 TestTable

In addition, we can compare any 2 tables in any remote clusters with specifying both peerId and --peerTableName.

For example:
hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.replication.VerifyReplication --peerTableName=peerTable zk1,zk2,zk3:2181/hbase TestTable
